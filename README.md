# ‚õìÔ∏è Blockchain from First Principles: A Secure Database System
## üéØ Project Mission & My Role
This project was a deep, self-led exploration into the core principles of distributed trust and cryptography. Our mission was to move beyond simply using blockchain technology and to instead build a functional blockchain from scratch in Java, based on foundational computer science concepts.

This was a true collaborative effort. As a key architect of the system, my role was to dive deep into the theoretical underpinnings of blockchain, including cryptographic principles and advanced data structures, and then translate that theory into robust, working code.

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture & Features
This is not a cryptocurrency project. It is a proof-of-concept for a secure, decentralized national database system, designed to be impenetrable to adversary attacks.

- Custom Blockchain Implementation: We did not use any external libraries. Every component‚Äîfrom the blocks and the ledger to the hashing and validation methods‚Äîwas built from first principles.
- Cryptographic Security: The system is secured using a combination of SHA-256 for hashing (ensuring data integrity) and RSA for encryption/decryption (ensuring data confidentiality).
- Advanced Data Structures: The core of the blockchain is built on a sophisticated implementation of linked lists and hash pointers, with stacks and queues used for transaction management.
- Dynamic Ledger System: The project includes a fully functional ledger that can be dynamically updated, with robust validation mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the entire chain.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Primary Language: Java
- Core Concepts: Blockchain, Cryptography (SHA-256, RSA), Data Structures (Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues), Object-Oriented Programming.
